                <h2>Why I Created This Portfolio</h2>
                <p>
                    In today's competitive job market, a traditional resume may not fully capture a candidate's
                    technical skills and projects. I built this portfolio to provide recruiters with a direct,
                    interactive way to explore my programming expertise, coursework, and certifications. This site not
                    only serves as an extended resume but also highlights my ability to work with multiple programming
                    languages while developing a structured and professional web presence.
